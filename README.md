# love-scale

Project Description:

Working as a frontend developer and building projects that are just static.
Can often times be boring 🤔🤔 so i created love-scale to spice 😊😚 up things up a bit by interracting with the backend, i could'nt develope my own api so 
i got a free api from rapidapi.com, so basically what love-scale does is this. it has two inputs one for the user's name and the other for their patner's name.
then submit's the name to the backend which send's back a result after matching both name's, the user is shown a result of the match. Please these results are just
random they are'nt actual fact's tho 😁😁. It's no reason to fall in love or fall out of love either. I went on to make the application validates the user's input's
so empty string's and number's are not submitted.
